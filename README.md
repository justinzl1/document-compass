Document Compass is an open-source platform that helps organizations intelligently organize, discover, and utilize their documents through AI-powered similarity matching and smart grouping. Built with both enterprise and nonprofit use cases in mind, it specifically addresses challenges in low-bandwidth environments and offers integration with popular cloud storage providers.

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
- Enable intelligent document discovery across large document collections
- Reduce time spent searching for related documents by 70%
- Make document management accessible in low-bandwidth environments
- Provide actionable insights through document summarization and grouping
- Integrate seamlessly with existing cloud storage solutions

### Target Users
- Nonprofits managing program documentation
- Organizations with distributed teams
- Educational institutions organizing learning materials
- Research teams managing related papers and studies
- Any team struggling with document discovery and organization

## 📈 Roadmap

### Phase 1
As a user, I would like to be able to upload and/or sync documents within Google Drive.  I would like the documents contained within the app to show me which ones are similar to one another and try to group them into folders based on similarity.
- [ ] Core similarity engine
- [ ] Basic document grouping
- [ ] Google Drive integration
- [ ] Initial API release

### Phase 2
As a product manager, I would like to use either Dropbox or Google Drive - this enables the most common cloud drive platforms to use what we have built.  As a user, I would like to have my documents summarized and then easily searched.  I would also like to use this application from my mobile device.
- [ ] Dropbox integration
- [ ] Advanced summarization
- [ ] Batch processing
- [ ] Mobile-responsive UI

### Phase 3 TODO - update this
- [ ] Enterprise features
- [ ] Advanced permission system
- [ ] Custom ML model training
- [ ] API rate limiting

### Phase 4 TODO - update this
- [ ] Additional storage providers
- [ ] Advanced analytics
- [ ] Workflow automation
- [ ] Enterprise SSO
